## 💡 Project Overview

**Information**:
- Author: Thomas Tuilier
- Version: 1.0
- Website link: [https://tuilier-thomas.netlify.app](https://tuilier-thomas.netlify.app)

This project is my personal portfolio showcasing some of my projects. It was created using `React` (based on `TypeScript`).

## 🌐 Deployment

In this project, I decided to try some free solutions for deployment.

For the frontend, I use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). With this solution, you don't need to own a domain name; you can simply use a Netlify subdomain.

I created a small backend in this GitHub repository: [message-form-backend](https://github.com/TuilierGit/message-form-backend), and deployed it using Render's free solution. To be honest, this is not the best option because the free Render service needs some time to start each time the frontend is launched. This backend deployment will change in the future for a more suitable solution.
